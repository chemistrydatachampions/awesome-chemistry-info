## Getting-Started
### Getting your data out of Excel
- [Excel vs R: when to use what](https://www.rforexcelusers.com/excel-vs-r-when-to-use-what/) - because Excel is a great tool, but another might be better.
### Plotting with R and Rstudio
- [Plotting some data in R](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/basic-tutorial.html) - make a plot!


## Formats and standards
- [FAIR chemistry data](https://iupac.org/iupac-endorses-the-chemistry-go-fair-manifesto/) - Chemistry Go Fair Manifesto. [Top 10 FAIR Data & Software Things](https://librarycarpentry.org/Top-10-FAIR/)
- PLUMED, an open-source library for enhanced sampling, free-energy calculations and the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. [Nature paper.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0506-8.pdf) [PLUMED-NEST repository](https://www.plumed-nest.org/). 

## Software
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - original and best.
- [ChemDataExtractor](http://chemdataextractor.org/) - automatically extract chemical information from scientific documents.

## ELN
- [OneNote](https://products.office.com/en-gb/onenote/digital-note-taking-app?rtc=1) - this comes with the University Office365 subscription.  Makes collaboration easier.
- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-gb/) - we get 1 Tb of free storage with our University Office365 subscription and it makes backing up to the cloud a breeze.

## Training resources
- [Periodic Table of the Open Research Ecosystem](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3263989) - this can be downloaded and adapted based on your own perspective and position in this ecosystem.
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) - a "lightly opinionated guide to reproducible data science" that can be adapted for our own use. Powerpoint slides about this resource are on [Zenodo.](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3292461)

## Machine learning and AI
- MELLODDY (Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery) - retain privacy while sharing pharmaceutical data. See https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31401-1/fulltext and https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/melloddy

## Experiments
- [IYCN (International Young Chemists' Network) Experiment Database](https://www.iycnglobal.com/experiments) - Experiments are freely available to download in different languages in a PDF file.
